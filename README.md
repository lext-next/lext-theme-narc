WORK IN PROGRESS. 

Since I am on Arch Linux, this software **will eventually be made** available on AUR: 
> $ yay -S lext-artwork-narc 

# lext-artwork-narc
This repository is the placeholder for AUR package **Narc-Colors-Theme** (a theme for LXQt)

The original work is at: https://codeberg.org/MrReplikant/Narc-Colors-Theme

> LXQt theme inspired by GNOME-Colors, mixing pieces and design elements of Lubuntu-Arc, Numix, and Marwaita. It comes with Openbox themes and wallpapers for each color palette, and the theme itself adjusts to the highlight color of the palettes.


This repo is used by my AUR for installing this theme on Arch Linux:
> $ yay -S lext-next/lext-artwork-narc

Don't forget to play with the various *palettes*.
