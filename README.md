# lext-artwork-narc-colors
This repository is the placeholder for AUR package that installs **Narc-Colors** (a theme for LXQt), and its associated *palettes* and some matching *wallpapers*.

The original work is at: https://codeberg.org/MrReplikant/Narc-Colors-Theme
> LXQt theme inspired by GNOME-Colors, mixing pieces and design elements of Lubuntu-Arc, Numix, and Marwaita. It comes with Openbox themes and wallpapers for each color palette, and the theme itself adjusts to the highlight color of the palettes.

Don't forget to play with the various *palettes*.
